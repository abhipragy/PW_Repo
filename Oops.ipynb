This approach to programming is well suited for software that is large, complex and actively updated or maintained. This includes programs for manufacturing and design, as well as mobile applications. For example, OOP can be used for manufacturing system simulation software."

Essentially, the subclass \"replaces\" the parent class's method with its own version, while maintaining the same method signature (name, parameters).\n",

        "\n",
        "    Polymorphism is crucial in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, promoting code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability. It allows for a single interface to be used for different operations, while each class can implement it in its own specific way.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
        "    1. Code Reusability and Extensibility:\n",
        "    Polymorphism allows you to write generic code that works with objects of different types, reducing redundancy and promoting code reuse.\n",
        "    You can add new subclasses without needing to modify existing code, making the system more extensible.\n",
        "    2. Flexibility and Maintainability:\n",
        "    Polymorphism enables dynamic method dispatch, where the method to be executed is determined at runtime, providing flexibility in method execution and object interaction.\n",

        "    3. Enhanced Code Organization:\n",
        "    Polymorphism allows you to focus on a parent class or interface, rather than managing numerous special cases, leading to a more organized codebase.\n",

This is achieved by having each method in the chain return the object itself (or a modified version of it), allowing subsequent methods to be called on the result.\n",
        "      To implement method chaining, each method in the class that is intended to be chainable should return self. self refers to the instance of the object, so returning self allows the next method in the chain to be called on the same object."
